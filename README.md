# Content-based-retrival-system
Using multimedia techniques to analyze, design, and implement content-based multimedia retrieval system, where the two media that we are going to use are the images and the videos.  
**We are using 3 techniques:**
 * **Average RGB:** taking the average for each color pixels in every image.
 * **Histogram:** acts as a counter for each individual color in every image
 * **Several Histogram:** which is slicing the image into certain number of divisions and comparing these slices by their histograms using (compareHist) function.
